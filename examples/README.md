# Examples of running stateful applications with Docker and PX-Dev

The following examples illustrate managing data volumes with stateful databases and applications.  Using PX-Dev, you can scale capacity, snapshot volumes, create clones and perform other SAN features using commodity hardware.
 * [Managing mysql database volumes with PX-Dev](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/examples/mysql.md) 
 * [Scaling a Cassandra database with PX-Dev](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/examples/cassandra.md) 
 * [Running the Docker registry with high availability](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/examples/registry.md)
